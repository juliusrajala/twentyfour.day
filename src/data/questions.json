        "question": "How do you approach choosing a tech stack for a new project?",
        "answer": "Selecting a stack for a new project can be tricky. There's often no single solution to solving any problem. Often, boring technology is better than exciting in the long run. What I think matters most is confidence in the selected tools, from both the perspective of the development team and the client. Every project is different, so consider special needs and future scalability then align your decision with those demands and expectations."
