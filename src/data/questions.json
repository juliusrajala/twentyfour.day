    "question": "How do you approach choosing a tech stack for a new project?",
    "answer": "Selecting a stack for a new project can be tricky. There's often no single solution to solving any problem. Often, boring technology is better than exciting in the long run. What I think matters most is confidence in the selected tools, from both the perspective of the development team and the client. Every project is different, so consider special needs and future scalability then align your decision with those demands and expectations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's your strategy for managing technical debt in ongoing projects?",
    "answer": "A personal favourite for me has been reserving one day in the working week to technical debt and refactoring of the hairier bits in projects. It can sometimes be difficult to justify time spent on this code gardening to the client, but it usually pays out to outline the accruing costs down the road that might follow. The more dependencies your system develops, the harder technical debt is to manage. So continuous maintenance is the way forward."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you balance innovation with maintaining existing systems?",
    "answer": "Innovation or new features, are certainly the target with the best short term return. Therefore, they're usually also what the client is more interested in. Maintenance keeps the lights on though and getting new users is hardly worth it if you can't keep them due to instability. Do critical maintenance work first. Build mostly features that create value for clients. After that, do everything else."

  {
    "question": "Can you describe a particularly challenging bug you encountered recently and how you resolved it?",
    "answer": "A recent bug I encountered was not super challenging, still a pain in the ass to debug. I’ve been working on a SvelteKit during my free time. I received reports, where users session would get randomly cut out and I could not figure out what was killing them. Turns out my project had preloading links set up on for all link elements, including a logout button I had grabbed from the project template. When users hovered on the button, the signout-page would be preloaded and their session destroyed. Solution: Use preloading with care."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure code quality and maintainability in your team?",
    "answer": "It sometimes frustrates me that we’re still struggling with issue regarding code quality and I’m mostly speaking in the superficial fashion. By the end of 2023, we should have had linters and formatters available that would make the conversation mostly moot. I use any and all automatic tools that advice you on code quality. Maintainability seems more of an architectural question. Though following SOLID still goes a long way in keeping our code maintainable."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key factors you consider for successful remote team collaboration?",
    "answer": "Remote teams should still maintain critical feedback loops that keep everyone in the team aware of each others work. Dailies and weeklies are all the more important when you’re not working in the same room with each other. Make work visible. Use your digital kanban. Schedule regular conversation time between team members. Have regular face-to-face meetings."
